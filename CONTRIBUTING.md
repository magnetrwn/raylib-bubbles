### Creating an Issue

If you find inconsistencies, bugs, or other problems, consider creating an issue describing the problem.

**Note:** for comments, please use the *Discussions* tab instead!

### Opening a Pull Request

+ **Fork** the repo,
+ **Clone** the forked repo to your local machine.
+ Create a new **branch** for your contribution: `git checkout -b feature`,
+ Make your changes and **commit** them: `git commit -m 'Added new feature'`,
+ **Push** the changes to your fork: `git push origin feature`,
+ Create a **pull request** on the main repo.

### Code Style

| Rule | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Brace Style | Use **K&R brace placement** for functions, classes, and control statements. |
| Indentation | Use **4 spaces** for indentation. Drop long initializer lists at one indent. |
| Naming Conventions | Use **`camelCase`** for variables and functions, and **`PascalCase`** for class names. |
| New Files | Use **LF line endings**, keep exactly one newline at the end of each file, use extension **`.hpp`** for C++ headers and **`.cpp`** for C++ source files. |
| Commenting | Short comments for complex logic are encouraged for public interfaces and significant private methods, using **`// NOTE:`** or **`// TODO:`** for important notes and tasks, but **please document the code in `README.md`** instead of in the code itself. |
